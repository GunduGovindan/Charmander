# CHARMANDER

Project CHARMANDER contains 3 games:
  •	An interactive game based on cricket : 
      “Chennai’28”
  •	A challenging physics-based game : 
      “Ricochet”
  •	A game that offers a twist on football :
      “Head Ball”
  Chennai’28 is a single player game based on cricket, whose core aspect focuses on sheer timing of the ball, where the player is the batsman. The aim of the player is     to chase down the target in a given number of balls. It has 3 difficulty levels, and the target relatively scales up with only 3 wickets per inning. 

  Ricochet is a game that tests your physics intuition. The aim of the game is to use a cannon to shoot a ball into a box, while taking care to ‘ricochet’ your ball       perfectly to land in the box. You have 3 tries and a time limit, so make sure the ball lands on time!

  Head Ball is a 1v1 game based on football but with new mechanics. The program is all about correctly timing and placing the ball into the opponent’s court, with witty 
  player movements. The first player to score 5 goals wins the game.
